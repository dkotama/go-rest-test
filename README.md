In quest for pursuing comfortable enviroment for me doing backend, i decided give golang a try. Based on this tutorial: https://www.codementor.io/codehakase/building-a-restful-api-with-golang-a6yivzqdo

# Build and run

$ go build && ./go-rest-test

and then fire your browser, heads up to localhost:8000
